memory_panel_title=Configure Default Memory Usage
memory_instructions=Memory settings are sensitive - particularly, if you are running multiple large applications, \
 it is easy to wind up with the Java heap in your swap file, at which point garbage collection \
 pauses become enormous.\n\nA good rule of thumb is a maximum of 1/4 of physical RAM up to a maximum of 2Gb, or \
 somewhat less if you routinely run several other large applications (say, a browser, an application \
 server and a database).\n\nHigher memory settings may appear to speed things up, until the Java heap \
 gets swapped to disk, at which point performance crashes.  Adjust these values conservatively.
