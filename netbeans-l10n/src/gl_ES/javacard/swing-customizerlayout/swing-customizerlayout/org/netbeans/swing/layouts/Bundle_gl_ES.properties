OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=Provides a layout manager for aligning components in nested panels.  A parent panel implements LayoutData and provides positioning information.  Child panels (typically with a single row of components) can use LDPLayout, which will use this data to ensure the X positions of all components match.<p>Useful in customizers where a child panel will be added and the parent panel has no knowledge of that child panel, but you want the result to look "designed" not like a bunch of unrelated panels randomly thrown together.
