OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Support for highlighting matching braces
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=This module adds support for highlighting matching areas of text in a document. These areas can be for example braces, brackets or parenthesis, but they can also be XML tags or others. The module implements highlighting and navigation (Jump-To) between the matching areas. The areas are automatically detected as the caret is moved through a document.
